# Netflix

## Introduction

Netflix is a dynamic web application designed to provide users with a seamless experience in exploring movies and TV shows. The platform offers comprehensive search capabilities, detailed information about movies, TV shows, and actors, and an intuitive interface for watching trailers.

## Aim of Project

The aim of this project is to create an engaging platform where users can easily search for and discover movies and TV shows, view trailers, and get detailed information about their favorite actors. The project also aims to provide a secure and personalized user experience through user authentication and protected routes.

## Technology Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **External API**: TMDB (The Movie Database)

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Signup and login functionality with JWT-based authentication.
- **Movie and TV Show Search**: Fetch detailed information about movies and TV shows from TMDB.
- **Actor Search**: Search for actors and view their filmography.
- **Watch Trailers**: View trailers for movies and TV shows.
- **Search History**: Track and display users' search history.
- **Protected Routes**: Ensure that only logged-in users can access certain features.
- **Custom 404 Page**: Provide a user-friendly experience with a custom 404 error page.

## Difficulties Faced

- **Integrating TMDB API**: Handling various endpoints and ensuring the correct parsing of data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implementing secure and efficient token management for user sessions.
- **Route Protection**: Ensuring seamless user experience while maintaining route protection.
- **State Management**: Managing state effectively across the application with React.

## Why Particular Technology

- **React.js**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, which makes it easy to build and maintain the user interface.
- **Node.js and Express.js**: Selected for their robust backend capabilities and ease of creating RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: Preferred for its flexible schema and ease of integration with Node.js.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for its utility-first approach, making it easy to style components quickly and consistently.
- **JWT**: Implemented for its secure and stateless authentication mechanism.

## Future Scope

- **User Reviews and Ratings**: Allow users to rate and review movies and TV shows.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provide personalized movie and TV show recommendations based on user preferences and search history.
- **Social Features**: Enable users to follow each other, share watchlists, and discuss movies and TV shows.
- **Advanced Search Filters**: Add more filters and sorting options for better search results.

## Great Learning

- **API Integration**: Gained experience in integrating and working with external APIs.
- **Authentication and Security**: Learned to implement and manage secure authentication mechanisms using JWT.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Improved skills in both frontend and backend development.
- **State Management**: Enhanced understanding of state management in React.
- **Responsive Design**: Created a responsive and user-friendly interface using Tailwind CSS.

## Conclusion

The Netflix project successfully combines modern web technologies to provide a feature-rich and secure platform for movie enthusiasts. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in full-stack development, API integration, and user authentication, which will be beneficial for future projects and professional growth.
